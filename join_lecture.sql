# ============================== JOINS
# Use joins when you need columns of data across multiple tables
# Use foreign keys to ensure referential integrity
#   (can't insert record with id for record that doesn't exist) and to clearly describe DB structure

# create tables for owners and pets

# ========= MINI EXERCISE 1
# Using the owners and pets table, display the pet age, pet name, and owner name.
